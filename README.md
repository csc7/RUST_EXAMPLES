# A Rust CLI template on Gitpod

This is a [Rust CLI](https://rust-starter.github.io) template configured for ephemeral development environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with a Rust CLI project on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## (Added Section)

## Own Project

This is a repository where I include basic examples in Rust; currently including the typical/known fizz-buzz and fibonacci (with recursion and memoization).

I have copied the code for the memoize and fibonacci functions.
fibonacci function is fib_memo2 in the original code.
